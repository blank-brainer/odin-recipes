    <h2>Description : </h2>
    <p>Slow Cooker Chicken Tikka Masala is a flavorful and aromatic dish that brings together tender chicken pieces in a
        rich, creamy tomato-based sauce infused with a blend of traditional Indian spices. To prepare this dish,
        boneless chicken pieces are marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices like cumin, coriander, garam masala, and
        turmeric, allowing the flavors to penetrate deeply.</p>

    <p>After marination, the chicken is slow-cooked with diced onions, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes in a crockpot or
        slow cooker, allowing the ingredients to meld together over several hours. The slow cooking process ensures that
        the chicken becomes incredibly tender and absorbs all the delicious flavors of the sauce. Towards the end of the
        cooking time, cream or coconut milk is added to create a luscious, creamy texture, balancing out the spices and
        adding a hint of sweetness.</p>

    <h2>Steps : </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken: </strong>In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with plain yogurt and a
            mixture of spices
            such as cumin, coriander, garam masala, turmeric, and paprika. Ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the
            marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or ideally overnight, to allow the flavors to
            meld.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Slow Cooker:</strong> Lightly grease the insert of your slow cooker to prevent sticking.
            You can also use
            a slow cooker liner for easier cleanup.</li>
        <li><strong>SautÃ© Aromatics: </strong>In a skillet or frying pan, heat a bit of oil over medium heat. Add diced
            onions, minced
            garlic, and minced ginger. SautÃ© until the onions are translucent and the mixture is fragrant, about 3-5
            minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Ingredients to the Slow Cooker:</strong>Transfer the sautÃ©ed onion mixture to the slow cooker
            insert. Place the marinated chicken pieces on top of the onions. Add canned diced tomatoes or tomato sauce
            to the slow cooker, spreading it evenly over the </li>
        <li><strong>Season and Cook:</strong> Sprinkle additional spices over the chicken and tomato mixture, such as
            cumin, coriander, garam masala, turmeric, paprika, and chili powder for extra heat if desired. Season with
            salt and black pepper to taste. Stir everything together gently to combine.</li>
        <li><strong>Slow Cook: </strong>Cover the slow cooker with its lid and cook on low heat for 4-6 hours, or until
            the chicken is cooked through and tender. Cooking times may vary depending on your slow cooker model and the
            size of the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream or Coconut Milk:</strong>Once the chicken is cooked, pour in heavy cream or coconut milk
            to add creaminess to the sauce. Stir well to incorporate the cream into the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust Seasoning:</strong>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if needed, adding more salt,
            pepper, or spices according to your preference.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Serve the Slow Cooker Chicken Tikka Masala hot over steamed basmati rice or with
            warm naan bread. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves for a burst of freshness.</li>
