    <h2>Description : </h2>
    <p>
        <em>Naan</em>, a quintessential component of <strong>Indian cuisine</strong>,is a type of leavened flatbread
        originating from
        the Indian subcontinent. Its origins can be traced back to the Persian influence on Indian culinary traditions.
        Typically made from wheat flour, water, yeast, and yogurt, <em>naan</em> dough is kneaded, rested, and then
        rolled into thin rounds before being baked in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay oven. The intense heat of the
        tandoor gives <em>naan</em> its characteristic bubbly texture and slightly charred flavor, making it a beloved
        accompaniment to various Indian dishes.
        <br>
        <em>Naan</em> comes in a variety of flavors and styles, with garlic <em>naan</em> and butter <em>naan</em> being
        among the most popular variations. Garlic <em>naan</em> is infused with minced garlic and often topped with
        cilantro, while butter <em>naan</em> is brushed with ghee or clarified butter after baking, adding richness and
        flavor. <em>Naan</em>'s versatility extends beyond its use as a side dish; it can also serve as a base for
        wraps, sandwiches, or even pizza-like creations, showcasing its adaptability and widespread appeal in both
        traditional and fusion cuisines.
